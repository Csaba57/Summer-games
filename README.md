# What's this?

Some games I made in the summer in C, using only the nano text editor.

## Running these games

These games are made for ubuntu linux.
For compiling I used **GCC**, so it is recommended to compile these games with GCC.
Download the **Ncurses** library, as it is used for fancy CLI display in all of these games, except Hangman.

## Compiling and running

gcc -Wall -o *[executableName]* *[.c filename]* -lncurses

./*[executableName]*
