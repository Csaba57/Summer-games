DAY1:
    implementing snake, field, apple, node basic structure
    the field struct's matrix consists of '.' characters and these characters aren't used anywhere except the drawField() function

DAY2:
    changing the field structure's matrix to be updated when the snake and apple spawns and when the snake moves
    introducing the syncFieldMatrix() function, it will be used int the init(), moveSnake(), and apple randomizer functions
    making the drawField() function "stupid" after the matrix upgrade
    optimizing the randomizeApplePosition() function
    making expandSnake() function
    refactored the checkAppleCollision() function

DAY3:
    when the player wins the whole field is getting filed with the snake's representation charcter
    changed the input system (instead of 4 variables for the directions I'll be using only one variable)
    the moveSnake() function no longer calls the syncFieldMatrix function

DAY4:
    made the basic window and point counter with ncurses (also added a struct to represent the screen)
    initNcurses() and endNcurses()
    **FIXED** a bug in the drawField() function (it was drawing an n*n matri all the time)

DAY5:
    automated the snake movement with wtimeout() and wgetch()
    adding 'wasd' keys as a new control to movement and removing the previous 'nswe' layout 
    adding arrow keys to the window with the keypad() function
    switched char type to int for playerInput()
    **TODO** fix the game over animation to be better
    fix the cursor on the small window to show
    refresh the points when an apple is eaten
DAY6:
    FIXED discorvered a floating point error when the player wins the game (the randomizeAppleposition had a zero division if there were no free cells left)
